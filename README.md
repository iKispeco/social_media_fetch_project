State manager: Redux

Simple web-app that use Redux as state manager, use functional components, REST API to fetch objects from server. 

Objects contain a lot of info on three main social media sites: Facebook and Instagram, and not social media Reduxjs.

This web-app is made as a practice project, so there is no real use of it.

It was supposed to show my expertise with Redux and REST Api services.

If you are testing web-app try to type: Facebook, Instagram or Reduxjs into the search bar.
